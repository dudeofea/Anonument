Anonument
=========

Simple, subtle, succinct. Born out of cynicism and lazyness on my part. I wanted something I could use to post complaints about the world around me and I wanted for it to be easy to start on a weekend.

With **anonument** you can create monuments for the things around you anonymously and comment on other people's monuments. That's the whole #! (shebang)

Though I know people aren't all cynics like me, so there's an option for a mood color for you to set the tone of the conversation. Doesn't mean people will listen though! No mods, no admins, no users, just text.
